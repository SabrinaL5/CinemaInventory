# CinemaInventory

Welcome to my SQL profile. The Cinema Inventory consists of data that showcases customers' movie bookings. 

Analysis 1: I determined why some of customers were missing data and how that affected the cinema's business. 
Analysis 2: I focused on the data discrepancy between the Rooms table and Seats table, and why some rooms were 
missing seats.
